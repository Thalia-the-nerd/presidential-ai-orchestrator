# This file defines the services that make up our application's backend.
# We are starting with just one service: our Redis message broker.

version: '3.8'

services:
  # This is the service name we will use to connect from our Python scripts.
  redis:
    # We use the official Redis image, with the 'alpine' tag for a smaller size.
    image: "redis:alpine"
    
    # This is the hostname of the redis container on the docker network.
    # Our Python orchestrator will connect to this hostname.
    hostname: redis
    
    # This maps the port inside the container (6379) to the same port on our
    # host machine. This allows us to connect to Redis from Python code
    # running on our local machine during development.
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
      
    # (Optional, but good practice for resilience)
    # This ensures that if the Redis container crashes, Docker will restart it automatically.
    restart: always
